;;; Commentary:

;; Minor mode that visualizes how font-lock refontifies a buffer.
;; This is useful when developing or debugging font-lock keywords,
;; especially for keywords that span multiple lines.
;;
;; The background of the buffer is painted in a rainbow of colors,
;; where each band in the rainbow represent a region of the buffer
;; that has been refontified.  When the buffer is modified, the
;; rainbow is updated.

;; Background:
;;
;; When you edit a file, font-lock mode recalculates syntax
;; highlighting as you type.  Clearly, this process must be fast.  If
;; not, Emacs would appear to be slow.  For this reason, as little as
;; possible is refontified, often only the line that was edited.  Once
;; Emacs is idle, a larger section is refontified.
;;
;; Unfortunately, some font-lock keywords doesn't work correctly when
;; applied to region which is too small.

;; Examples:
;;
;; You can use this tool, for example, to:
;;
;; - Investigate when font-lock makes Emacs slow. If a large region is
;;   refontified for every character typed, could cause this.
;;
;; - Investigate why a font-lock rule sometimes work, sometimes
;;   doesn't.  One cause of this could be that the region starts in
;;   the middle of the language construct that should be highlighted.
;;
;; - Investigate "blinking" syntax highlighting, i.e. the effect where
;;   one color is first applied, and after, say, half a second,
;;   another is applied.

;; The refontification process:
;;
;; When font-lock decides to update a region, it calls the functions
;; in `font-lock-extend-region-functions'.  Each function can extend
;; the region.  For example, when `font-lock-multiline' is enabled,
;; the function `font-lock-extend-region-multiline' is included.  It
;; will extend the region to include all the lines of something that
;; previously was matched in a multiline rule.

;; Usage:
;;
;; - `M-x highlight-refontification-mode RET' -- When this mode is
;;   enabled, any change in the buffer is visualized by a change in
;;   the background color.
;;
;; - `M-x highlight-refontification-list-extend-region-steps RET' --
;;   Print the steps font-lock would take to extend a region.

;; Other Font Lock Tools:
;;
;; This package is part of a suite of font-lock tools.  The other
;; tools in the suite are:
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Studio:
;;
;; Interactive debugger for font-lock keywords (Emacs syntax
;; highlighting rules).
;;
;; Font Lock Studio lets you *single-step* Font Lock keywords --
;; matchers, highlights, and anchored rules, so that you can see what
;; happens when a buffer is fontified. You can set *breakpoints* on or
;; inside rules and *run* until one has been hit. When inside a rule,
;; matches are *visualized* using a palette of background colors. The
;; *explainer* can describe a rule in plain-text English. Tight
;; integration with *Edebug* allows you to step into Lisp expressions
;; that are part of the Font Lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Profiler:
;;
;; A profiler for font-lock keywords.  This package measures time and
;; counts the number of times each part of a font-lock keyword is
;; used.  For matchers, it counts the total number and the number of
;; successful matches.
;;
;; The result is presented in table that can be sorted by count or
;; time.  The table can be expanded to include each part of the
;; font-lock keyword.
;;
;; In addition, this package can generate a log of all font-lock
;; events.  This can be used to verify font-lock implementations,
;; concretely, this is used for back-to-back tests of the real
;; font-lock engine and Font Lock Studio, an interactive debugger for
;; font-lock keywords.
;;
;;
;; Faceup:
;;
;; Emacs is capable of highlighting buffers based on language-specific
;; `font-lock' rules. This package makes it possible to perform
;; regression test for packages that provide font-lock rules.
;;
;; The underlying idea is to convert text with highlights ("faces")
;; into a plain text representation using the Faceup markup
;; language. This language is semi-human readable, for example:
;;
;;     «k:this» is a keyword
;;
;; By comparing the current highlight with a highlight performed with
;; stable versions of a package, it's possible to automatically find
;; problems that otherwise would have been hard to spot.
;;
;; This package is designed to be used in conjunction with Ert, the
;; standard Emacs regression test system.
;;
;; The Faceup markup language is a generic markup language, regression
;; testing is merely one way to use it.
;;
;;
;; Font Lock Regression Suite:
;;
;; A collection of example source files for a large number of
;; programming languages, with ERT tests to ensure that syntax
;; highlighting does not accidentally change.
;;
;; For each source file, font-lock reference files are provided for
;; various Emacs versions.  The reference files contains a plain-text
;; representation of source file with syntax highlighting, using the
;; format "faceup".
;;
;; Of course, the collection source file can be used for other kinds
;; of testing, not limited to font-lock regression testing.
